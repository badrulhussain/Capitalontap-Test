# Capitalontap Test
I done this test giving myself no more than 4 hours.
 
I did not have time to add automation testing.

Due to the fact we are in fourth gen programing language and there is not nead write unreadable code with loads of comments when you can write clean readable codes.

I wrote the code in away where I have extended the flight system to meet the task requirement and as we get more tasks we slowly chip away the old system and move into the new structured system. Because it will take forever to change an old system and have bugs to deals with later. When a better solution would be to write a new system.
